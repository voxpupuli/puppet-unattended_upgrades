APT::Periodic::RandomSleep "<%= @random_sleep %>";
#  - The apt cron job will delay its execution by a random
#    time span between zero and 'APT::Periodic::RandomSleep'
#    seconds.
#    This is done because otherwise everyone would access the
#    mirror servers at the same time and put them collectively
#    under very high strain.
#    You can set this to '0' if you are using a local mirror and
#    do not care about the load spikes.
#    Note that sleeping in the apt job will be delaying the
#    execution of all subsequent cron.daily jobs.
